# Churn-Prediction-and-Interpretation-using-Random-Forest-and-LIME
This project focuses on predicting customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave a service) using a Random Forest Classifier and providing interpretable insights into the predictions using LIME . The goal is to build an accurate churn prediction model while making its decisions understandable to stakeholders.
